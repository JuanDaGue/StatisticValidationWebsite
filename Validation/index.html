        <h1>Validation Statistical Model of the 21 cm Cosmological Signal</h1>
        <p>
            This project explores the statistical validation of the 21 cm cosmological signal model reported by the EDGES radio telescope. 
            The research involves complex data analysis and validation techniques to confirm the authenticity and accuracy of the cosmological signal model.

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to validate the physical models developed by the EDGES radio telescope collaboration [6], who collected data to measure the 21 cm cosmological signal produced by primordial hydrogen during the reionization era. These publicly accessible data were used to replicate the physical and statistical models reported by the collaboration [6], with which a model of the sky temperature signal

  was developed using Bayesian statistics. The goal was to reproduce the reported detection of the 21 cm signal from primordial hydrogen.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
            The 21 cm line is a key observational probe of the early universe, providing insights into the 
            epoch of reionization and the formation of the first stars and galaxies.

        </p>
        <p>The validation process was carried out using the Gelman-Rubin discrepancy criterion [7], which was employed to verify the model's ability to reproduce synthetic data that adequately mimic the observations made by the antenna. Out of the four models analyzed in this article, it was not possible to fully validate the absorption of primordial hydrogen, as, despite statistically solid models, no physical value was obtained for the foreground temperature

    <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            We employed advanced statistical methods, including Bayesian inference and machine learning models, 
            to analyze the data obtained from the EDGES radio telescope. The validation process involved 
            cross-referencing with other cosmological observations and simulations.

    <section id="model">
        <h2>Model</h2>
        <p>
            The model used in this study is based on the standard cosmological model, with adjustments to account 
            for potential anomalies in the 21 cm signal. We have developed a robust framework that incorporates 
            various astrophysical and cosmological parameters to enhance the reliability of the model.

            <p>The data used are Frequency (ŒΩ[MHz]) vs Sky Temperature (T<sub>sky</sub>[K]). The temperature (T<sub>sky</sub>) is modeled as the sum of T<sub>F</sub> ‚ÄúForeground Temperature‚Äù and T<sub>21</sub> ‚Äú21 cm Temperature‚Äù.</p>

        <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Data analysis was performed using Python and specialized libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and Astropy. 
            The analysis focused on noise reduction, signal extraction, and statistical validation of the results.

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
        <p>
            Our findings suggest that the 21 cm signal reported by EDGES is consistent with theoretical expectations, 
            but further observations and validations are required to confirm this discovery. The model developed 
            in this project provides a solid foundation for future research in this area.
